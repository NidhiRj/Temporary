Git Functions:

To create a local git repository:
*Install git to your system.
*To initialise a directory as git use "git init" command
*To add files to this directory use "git add ."
The above step will add all the files into git
*To add your remote repo as origin use "git remote add origin "your repository""
*To add files from your local repo to remote repo use push command "git push - origin main"
*To add the changes done on your github repo to your local repo use command "git fetch" and "git merge"

SSH Key :

*To generate SSH key use the command "$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<emailid connected with github>"
Upon execution of the above step,the terminal will prompt you to add passphrase and filename in which the keys are stored.
If needed enter an appropriate one,else just hit enter.
The next step is to add ssh key to agent, for that first launch ssh agent using "$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)".
To add key to agent,use "$ ssh-add "
After key generation, to add them to github copy the contents of public key.
Then login to your hithub account inside which settings will be seen.
In settings,goto SSH and GPG keys.In that page you can add a ssh key by giving it an appropriate description and pasting the public key.
To ensure that the ssh key is working perfectly try any git commands.
